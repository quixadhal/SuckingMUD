IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------

The Lil mudlib is for expert LP coders. It is NOT for
beginners. If you are not a hardcore LP lib coder, this
is not the lib for you. Choose a lib from the lpmuds.net
downloads page instead: http://lpmuds.net/downloads.html


If you *are* a hardcore LP lib coder:

1) unzip the distribution file.

2) Move/rename the folder so that it is c:\lil

3) there should now be a c:\lil folder, containing bin, lib, etc. If
   there isn't one, rename the directory you just created to c:\lil
   For example, there should be a c:\lil\bin, c:\lil\lib, etc.

4) double-click on c:\lil\win32\mud.bat

5) telnet to your local machine on port 4000. 

6) Enjoy!
